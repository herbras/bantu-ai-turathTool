# Scientific Literature Integration

The Turath AI system now supports **scientific literature search** with Islamic perspective for medical and technology topics.

## Features

### Multi-Domain Search Capabilities
1. **Islamic Texts** - Internal MCP database
2. **General Web Search** - Tavily API  
3. **Scientific Literature** - ArXiv + PubMed with Islamic context

### Smart Query Detection
The agent automatically detects query types and routes to appropriate tools:

```python
# Medical queries -> PubMed + Islamic bioethics
"organ transplantation Islamic ethics" -> Medical

# Technology queries -> ArXiv + Islamic ethics  
"artificial intelligence Islamic perspective" -> Technology

# Combined queries -> Both sources
"AI in medical diagnosis Islamic bioethics" -> Both
```

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Required for ArXiv search
uv add arxiv pypdf

# Or with pip
pip install arxiv pypdf
```

### 2. Optional: Enable All Features
```bash
# For complete functionality
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-key"
```

### 3. Test Installation
```bash
uv run python test_scientific_tools.py
```
